SUMMUM certiorari to the</span><span class='style-3'> united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit </span><span class='style-2'>No. 07\226665. Argued November 12, 2008\227Decided February 25, 2009 Pioneer Park \(Park\a public park in petitioner Pleasant Grove City \(City\</span><span class='style-2'>has at least 11 permanent, privately donated displays, including a Ten Commandments monument. In rejecting the request of respond\022ent Summum, a religious organization, to erect a monument containing the Seven Aphorisms of Summum, the City explained that it limited Park monuments to those either directly related to the City\222s history or donated by groups with longstanding community ties. After the City put that policy and other criteria into writing, respondent renewed its request, but did not describe the monument\222s historical signi\036cance or respondent\222s connection to the community. The City rejected the re\022quest, and respondent \036led suit, claiming that the City and petitioner of\036cials had violated the First Amendment\222s Free Speech Clause by accepting the Ten Commandments monument but rejecting respondent\222s proposed monument. The District Court denied respondent\222s prelimi\022nary injunction request, but the Tenth Circuit reversed. Noting that it had previously found the Ten Commandments monument to be private rather than government speech and that public parks have traditionally been regarded as public forums, the court held that, because the exclu\022sion of the monument was unlikely to survive strict scrutiny, the City was required to erect it immediately. Held: The placement of a permanent monument in a public park is a form of </span><span class='style-2'>government speech and is therefore not subject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause. Pp. 467\226481. \(a\Because that Clause restricts government regulation of private speech but </span><span class='style-2'>not government speech, whether petitioners were engaging in their own expressive conduct or providing a forum for private speech determines which precedents govern here.

Restrictions based on viewpoint are also pro\022hibited. Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 463. Government restrictions on speech in a \223designated public forum\224 are subject to the same strict scrutiny as restrictions in a traditional public forum. Cornelius, supra, at 800. And where government creates a forum that is limited to use by certain groups or dedicated to the discussion of certain subjects, Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, n. 7, it may impose reasonable and viewpoint-neutral restrictions, see Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106\226107. Pp. 469\226470. \(b\Permanent monuments displayed on public property typically represent gover</span><span class='style-2'>nment speech. Governments have long used monu\022ments to speak to the public. Thus, a government-commissioned and government-\036nanced monument placed on public land constitutes gov\022ernment speech. So, too, are privately \036nanced and donated monu\022ments that the government accepts for public display on government land. While government entities regularly accept privately funded or donated monuments, their general practice has been one of selective receptivity. Because city parks play an important role in de\036ning the identity that a city projects to its residents and the outside world, cities take care in accepting donated monuments, selecting those that por\022tray what the government decisionmakers view as appropriate for the place in question, based on esthetics, history, and local culture. The accepted monuments are meant to convey and have the effect of con\022veying a government message and thus constitute government speech. Pp. 470\226472. \(c\Here, the Park\222s monuments clearly represent government speech.

Pp. 472\226473. \(d\Respondent\222s legitimate concern that the government speech doc\022tri</span><span class='style-2'>ne not be used as a subterfuge for favoring certain viewpoints does not mean that a government entity should be required to embrace pub\022licly a privately donated monument\222s \223message\224 in order to escape Free Speech Clause restrictions. A city engages in expressive conduct by accepting and displaying a privately donated monument, but it does not necessarily endorse the speci\036c meaning that any particular donor sees in the monument. A government\222s message may be altered by the sub\022sequent addition of other monuments in the same vicinity. It may also change over time. Pp. 473\226478. \(e\\223[P]ublic forum principles . . . are out of place in the context of this </span><span class='style-2'>case.\224 United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, 205. The forum doctrine applies where a government property or program is capable of accommodating a large number of public speakers without defeating the essential function of the land or program, but public parks can accommodate only a limited number of permanent mon\022uments. If governments must maintain viewpoint neutrality in select\022ing donated monuments, they must either prepare for cluttered parks or face pressure to remove longstanding and cherished monuments. Were public parks considered traditional public forums for the purpose of erecting privately donated monuments, most parks would have little choice but to refuse all such donations. And if forum analysis would lead almost inexorably to closing of the forum, forum analysis is out of place. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, distinguished.

SUMMUM Opi</span><span class='style-2'>nion of the Court </span><span class='style-3'>Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court. This case presents the question whether the Free Speech Clause of </span><span class='style-3'>the First Amendment entitles a private group to insist that a municipality permit it to place a permanent monument in a city park in which other donated monuments were previously erected. The Court of Appeals held that the municipality was required to accept the monument be\022cause a public park is a traditional public forum. We con\022clude, however, that although a park is a traditional public forum for speeches and other transitory expressive acts, the display of a permanent monument in a public park is not a form of expression to which forum analysis applies. In\022stead, the placement of a permanent monument in a public park is best viewed as a form of government speech and is therefore not subject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause.

Respondent Summum is a religious organization founded in </span><span class='style-3'>1975 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. On two separate occasions in 2003, Summum\222s president wrote a let\022ter to the City\222s mayor requesting permission to erect a \223stone monument,\224 which would contain \223the Seven Apho\022risms of SUMMUM\224 </span><span class='style-4'>1 </span><span class='style-3'>and be similar in size and nature to the Ten Commandments monument. App. 57, 59.

Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, n. 7. In such a forum, a government entity may impose restrictions on speech that are reasonable and viewpoint neutral. See Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106\226107 \(2001\III There may be situations in which it is dif\036cult to tell whether a </span><span class='style-3'>government entity is speaking on its own behalf or is providing a forum for private speech, but this case does not present such a situation. Permanent monuments dis\022played on public property typically represent government speech. Governments have long used monuments to speak to the public. </span><span class='style-3'>Since ancient times, kings, emperors, and other rul\022ers have erected statues of themselves to remind their subjects of their authority and power. Triumphal arches, columns, and other monuments have been built to commemo\022rate military victories and sacri\036ces and other events of civic importance. A monument, by de\036nition, is a structure that is designed as a means of expression. When a government entity arranges for the construction of a monument, it does so because it wishes to convey some thought or instill some feeling in those who see the structure. Neither the Court of Appeals nor respondent disputes the obvious proposition that a monument that is commissioned and \036nanced by a government body for placement on public land constitutes government speech. Just as government-commissioned and government\022\036nanced </span><span class='style-3'>monuments speak for the government, so do pri\022vately \036nanced and donated monuments that the govern\022</span><span class='style-0'>555US2</span><span class='style-1'>Unit:</span><span class='style-0'>$U26</span><span class='style-1'>[01-16-1415:27:48]PAGESPGT:</span><span class='style-0'>OPIN</span><span class='style-2'>471 Cite as: 555 U. S. 460 \(2009\Opinion of the Court </span><span class='style-3'>ment accepts and displays to the public on government land. It certainly is not common for property owners to open up their property for the installation of permanent monuments that convey a message with which they do not wish to be associated. And because property owners typically do not permit the construction of such monuments on their land, persons who observe donated monuments routinely\227and reasonably\227interpret them as conveying some message on the property owner\222s behalf. In this context, there is little chance that observers will fail to appreciate the identity of the speaker. This is true whether the monument is located on private property or on public property, such as national, state, or city park land. We think it is fair to say that throughout our Nation\222s his\022tory, </span><span class='style-3'>the general government practice with respect to do\022nated monuments has been one of selective receptivity. A great many of the monuments that adorn the Nation\222s public parks were \036nanced with private funds or donated by pri\022vate parties. Sites managed by the National Park Service contain thousands of privately designed or funded commemo\022rative objects, including the Statue of Liberty, the Marine Corps War Memorial \(the Iwo Jima monument\and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. States and cities likewise have received thousands of donated monuments. See, e. g., App. to Brief for International Municipal Lawyers Associa\022tion as Amicus Curiae 15a\22629a \(hereinafter IMLA Brief\\(listing examples\Brief for American Legion et al. as Amici Curiae 7, and n. 2 \(same\By accepting monuments that are privately funded or donated, government entities save tax dollars and are able to acquire monuments that they could not have afforded to fund on their own.

Public parks are often closely identi\036ed in the public mind with </span><span class='style-3'>the government unit that owns the land. City parks\227 ranging from those in small towns, like Pioneer Park in Pleasant Grove City, to those in major metropolises, like Central Park in New York City\227commonly play an impor\022tant role in de\036ning the identity that a city projects to its own residents and to the outside world. Accordingly, cities and other jurisdictions take some care in accepting donated monuments. Government decisionmakers select the monu\022ments that portray what they view as appropriate for the place in question, taking into account such content-based fac\022tors as esthetics, history, and local culture. The monuments that are accepted, therefore, are meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a government message, and they thus constitute government speech. IV\021 A\021 In this case, it is clear that the monuments in Pleasant Grove\222s </span><span class='style-3'>Pioneer Park represent government speech. Al\022though many of the monuments were not designed or built by the City and were donated in completed form by private entities, the City decided to accept those donations and to display them in the Park.

S. 460 \(2009\Opinion of the Court </span><span class='style-3'>the City ever opened up the Park for the placement of what\022ever permanent monuments might be offered by private do\022nors. Rather, the City has \223effectively controlled\224 the mes\022sages sent by the monuments in the Park by exercising \223\036nal approval authority\224 over their selection. Johanns, 544 U. S., at 560\226561. The City has selected those monuments that it </span><span class='style-3'>wants to display for the purpose of presenting the image of the City that it wishes to project to all who frequent the Park; it has taken ownership of most of the monuments in the Park, including the Ten Commandments monument that is the focus of respondent\222s concern; and the City has now expressly set forth the criteria it will use in making future selections. B Respondent voices the legitimate concern that the govern\022ment speech </span><span class='style-3'>doctrine not be used as a subterfuge for favor\022ing certain private speakers over others based on viewpoint. Respondent\222s suggested solution is to require a government entity accepting a privately donated monument to go through a formal process of adopting a resolution publicly embracing \223the message\224 that the monument conveys. See Brief for Respondent 33\22634, 57. We see no reason for imposing a requirement of this sort. The parks </span><span class='style-3'>of this country contain thousands of donated mon\022uments that government entities have used for their own expressive purposes, usually without producing the sort of formal documentation that respondent now says is required to escape Free Speech Clause restrictions. Requiring all of these jurisdictions to go back and proclaim formally that they adopt all of these monuments as their own expressive vehicles would be a pointless exercise that the Constitution does not mandate. In this case, for example, although respondent argues that Pleasant Grove </span><span class='style-3'>City has not adequately \223controll[ed] the message,\224 id., at 31, of the Ten Commandments monument, the City took ownership of that monument and put it on per\022</span><span class='style-0'>555US2</span><span class='style-1'>Unit:</span><span class='style-0'>$U26</span><span class='style-1'>[01-16-1415:27:48]PAGESPGT:</span><span class='style-0'>OPIN</span><span class='style-2'>474 PLEASANT GROVE CITY v.

All rights previously pos\022sessed by the monument\222s donor have been relinquished. The City\222s actions provided a more dramatic form of adoption than the sort of formal endorsement that respondent would demand, unmistakably signifying to all Park visitors that the City intends the monument to speak on its behalf. And the City has made no effort to abridge the traditional free speech rights\227the right to speak, distribute lea\037ets, etc.\227that may be exercised by respondent and others in Pioneer Park. What respondent demands, however, is that the City \223adopt\224 or </span><span class='style-3'>\223embrace\224 \223the message\224 that it associates with the monument. Id., at 33\22634, 57. Respondent seems to think that a monument can convey only one \223message\224\227 which is, presumably, the message intended by the donor\227 and that, if a government entity that accepts a monument for placement on its property does not formally embrace that message, then the government has not engaged in expres\022sive conduct. This argument fundamentally misunderstands the way monuments con</span><span class='style-3'>vey meaning. The meaning conveyed by a monument is generally not a simple one like \223 \221Beef. It\222s What\222s for Dinner.\222 \224 Johanns, supra, at 554. Even when a monument features the written word, the monument may be intended to be interpreted, and may in fact be interpreted by different observers, in a variety of ways. Monuments called to our attention by the brie\036ng in this case illustrate this phenomenon. What, for example, is \223the message\224 of the Greco-Roman mosaic of </span><span class='style-3'>the word \223Imagine\224 that was donated to New York City\222s Central Park in memory of John Lennon?

Indeed, when a privately donated memorial is funded by many small dona\022tions, the donors themselves may differ in their interpreta\022tion of the monument\222s signi\036cance.</span><span class='style-4'>6 </span><span class='style-3'>By accepting such a monument, a government entity does not necessarily endorse </span><span class='style-5'>4 </span><span class='style-2'>The Presidio Trail: A Historical Walking Tour of Downtown Tucson, on\022line at http://www.visittucson.org/includes/media/docs/DowntownTour.pdf \(as visited Feb. 24, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\222s case \036le\</span><span class='style-5'>5 </span><span class='style-2'>Museum collections illustrate this phenomenon. Museums display works of art that express many different sentiments, and the signi\036cance of a donated work of art to its creator or donor may differ markedly from a museum\222s reasons for accepting and displaying the work. For example, a painting of a religious scene may have been commissioned and painted to express religious thoughts and feelings. Even if the painting is do\022nated to the museum by a patron who shares those thoughts and feelings, it does not follow that the museum, by displaying the painting, intends to convey or is perceived as conveying the same \223message.\224 </span><span class='style-5'>6 </span><span class='style-2'>For example, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund is a private organi\022zation that obtained funding from over 650,000 donors for the construction of the memorial itself.

The obvious truth of the matter is that if public parks were considered to be traditional public forums for the purpose of erecting privately donated monuments, most parks would have little choice but to refuse all such donations.

But it is also obvious that from the start, the case has been litigated in the shadow of the First Amendment\222s Establishment Clause: the city wary of associ\022ating itself too closely with the Ten Commandments monu\022ment displayed in the park, lest that be deemed a breach in the so-called \223wall of separation between church and State,\224 Reynolds v.

To the contrary, all the Justices agreed that government speech was at issue, but the Establishment Clause argument was nonetheless rejected.

Were Pleasant Grove City \(City\to discriminate in the selection of permanent monuments on grounds unrelated to the display\222s theme, say, solely on political grounds, its action might well violate the First Amendment.

And, in doing so, it helps to ask whether a government action burdens speech disproportionately in light of the action\222s tendency to further a legitimate government objective.

Rather, the City has simply reserved some space in the park for projects designed to further other than free\022speech goals. And that is perfectly proper. After all, parks do not serve speech-related interests alone.

SUMMUM Souter,</span><span class='style-2'> J., concurring in judgment </span><span class='style-3'>is no doubt that this case and its government speech claim has been litigated by the parties with one eye on the Estab\022lishment Clause, see ante, at482 \(Scalia, J., concurring\The interaction between the \223government speech doctrine\224 and Establishment Clause principles has not, however, begun to be worked out. The case shows that it may not be easy to work out. After </span><span class='style-3'>today\222s decision, whenever a government maintains a monument it will presumably be understood to be engaging in government speech. If the monument has some religious character, the specter of violating the Establishment Clause will behoove it to take care to avoid the appearance of a \037atout establishment of religion, in the sense of the govern\022ment\222s adoption of the tenets expressed or symbolized. In such an instance, there will be safety in numbers, and it will be in the interest of a careful government to accept other monuments to stand nearby, to dilute the appearance of adopting whatever particular religious position the single ex\022ample alone might stand for. As mementoes and testimoni\022als pile up, however, the chatter may well make it less intu\022itively obvious that the government is speaking in its own right simply by maintaining the monuments. If a case like that occurred, as suspicion grew that some of the </span><span class='style-3'>permanent displays were not government speech at all \(or at least had an equally private character associated with private donors\a further Establishment Clause prohi\022bition would surface, the bar against preferring some reli\022gious speakers over others.

Under this view of the relationship be\022tween the two doctrines, it would be easy for a government to favor some private religious speakers over others by its choice of monuments to accept. Whether that view turns out to be sound is more than I can say </span><span class='style-3'>at this point. It is simply unclear how the relatively new category of government speech will relate to the more traditional categories of Establishment Clause analysis, and this case is not an occasion to speculate. It is an occasion, however, to try to keep the inevitable issues open, and as simple as they can be. One way to do that is to recognize that there are circumstances in which government main\022tenance of monuments does not look like government speech at all. Sectarian identi\036cations on markers in Arlington Cemetery come to mind. And to recognize that is to forgo any categorical rule at this point. To avoid relying on a per</span><span class='style-3'> se rule to say when speech is governmental, the best approach that occurs to me is to ask whether a reasonable and fully informed observer would un\022derstand the expression to be government speech, as distinct from private speech the government chooses to oblige by allowing the monument to be placed on public land. This reasonable observer test for governmental character is of a piece with the one for spotting forbidden governmental en\022dorsement of religion in the Establishment Clause cases. See, e. g., County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 630, 635\226 636 \(1989\\(O\222Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment\The adoption of it would thus serve coherence within Establishment Clause law, and it would make sense of our common understanding that some monuments on pub\022lic land display religious symbolism that clearly does not ex\022press a government\222s chosen views. Application of this observer test provides the reason I \036nd the monument </span><span class='style-3'>here to be government expression. </span>
